# cloud-server
A basic cloud server. 
A basic web application to implement a cloud server. 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery is used to design the front end. The back end is written completely in PHP. MariaDB is used as 
the Database Management System.

'files' folder has all the external scripts used by the intial HTML pages. 

Still a huge work in progress.
